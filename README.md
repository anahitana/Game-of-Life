# Game-of-Life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton, which is a type of mathematical model that simulates the behavior of a large number of cells or particles.

In the Game of Life, there is a grid of cells, which can be either alive or dead. The cells are updated according to a set of rules based on their current state and the state of their neighboring cells. 
The rules are simple but can lead to complex and unpredictable patterns of behavior.

The first simulation is random
you can use T for turtule simulation and so on...
